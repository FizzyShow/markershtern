**Protobuffet is built as a set of packages that extend the Docusaurus site generator with Protobuf views.**

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/) provides a powerful foundation for generating documentation and other content-focused sites. It renders content based on markdown ([`.mdx`](https://mdxjs.com/)) files with support for React components. Protobuffet is built on top of this foundation to follow the same standards and practices. Flexibility is important when choosing a documentation framework for your organization and Docusaurus was the best choice for Protobuffet in this area.

I highly encourage you to get familiar with their [great documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-introduction), but here is a summary of what it provides for this project:

- Modern Jamstack documentation site.
- Solid React and MDX foundation.
- Support of plugins and themes that allow for easy extension.
- Emphasis on developer-driven documentation.
